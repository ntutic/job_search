Hi,

You can see some of my GUI projects in the images attached, I have made extensions, namely used in a company of >60, and many desktop GUIs, mostly in the farming industry. Please refer to my profile portfolio¹ if you wish to see more.

I propose to complete this project for a fixed price of $300 based on my 12h estimate at $25/h shown below². Since you need this as a web app per my understanding, I would do it with Django to create a simple page with a form to upload both of your files. The processing will happen on picture upload with a Python script for merging the pictures as shown using a library such as PIL. You will see displayed on the webapp both the input pictures and the output merge, with a "download" button.

If you want this as a simple local app, I can compile the project so that you get a dependency-free .exe file that starts the server. It will come with a system tray icon for exit and as a status indicator. You can then load your app in your browser like "localhost:8090" (the app could launch it at start, and the tray icon could have a "open" option). Otherwise, you can host the project on your own machine or some place like AWS EC2 on an open port to make it available on one of your domains.

But if you don't need to make this web-based as introduced, we can make a simple desktop app with Python and Qt to give you an application window open with the .exe. It would have the same layout and description laid out above. 

Kindly thank you for your consideration,
Nikola
