Hi,

While we would need to talk details, the solution I propose would be this price for a fairly simple scraper and comes with the following parts :
- script in Python for scraping the data with an appropriate library (scrapy, Selenium or requests based on your needs);
- a graphical user interface where the user can configure and launch the script¹;
- compiled to a native Windows (.exe) or Linux application, no Python dependencies for running the program;
- output results to any file (i.e. CSV, JSON, ...) or cloud storage/database (i.e. AWS S3 & RDS, ...);
- a system tray icon for easy access and current status if program is to be running in the background; 

If the crawler you're after is quite complex then we might renegotiate the price, but for a reasonably simple project this should be fine. 


Thank you,
Nikola

I've been building scrapers since I started programming and from my first projects on Upwork. 
I've made robust software like a Chrome extension² used in a company of over 60 and multiple GUIs³ for monitoring and controlling dairy industrial machines
